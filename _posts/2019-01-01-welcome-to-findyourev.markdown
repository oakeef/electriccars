Hello and welcome to Find Your EV! On this site you will find all sorts of great information about Electric Vehicles. The goal is to help educate Canadians, and anyone else that visits, on all the pros and cons of Electric Vehicles to find out if one is right for you. On top of that this site will have tools which can help you research which EV (used or new) is right for you based on all sorts of different criteria.

I got the idea to make this site because I spend tons of time on Autotrader and I noticed it's kind of tricky to find used EV on there. I started with a spreadsheet just to keep track of how many are available and what kind of prices they go for on the used market. From there I started adding all sorts of details about each vehicle to the point where my spreadsheet was starting to become a database, so I figured lets turn this into a website.

I hope you enjoy the site and learn something new about EVs in the process! Also all prices on the site are from Autotrader and in Canadian dollars.
