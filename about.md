This website is a pet project of mine. I became interested in Electric Vehicles and realized there is a shortage of information on them, especially on used EV. It all started as a spreadsheet to find out how many EV were available in Canada and what the used prices looked like. 

I decided to turn the spreadsheet into a website that could help educate and inform people in Canada on how owning an EV works, why you shouldn't be afraid to buy one, even a used one. As well as all the pros and cons that come with owning an EV.
